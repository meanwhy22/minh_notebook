## Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   I am a recent master's graduate (and soon-to-be PhD student) in life science. I have an interest in skeletal muscle biology and epigenetics. This is why the data chosen revolve mainly around these two themes.

-   I've been trained mostly at the bench and am not very good at computer in general. Therefore, most of the codes are generated by Google-ing and ChatGPT-ing. I'm sorry if they don't look neat and tidy enough. I will try to cite every source that I learn from, but sometimes it is a bit of reference here and there and some of them might be missed.

-   As we mentioned ChatGPT, this HTML-website was built, and is being constantly refined, over hours of chatting with the AI.
